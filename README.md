# My Go Learning Journey

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my journey in learning Golang, a statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity and effectiveness, developed by Google. The repository includes the projects I have developed during this period

# Installation & Usage
Most of the code in this repository can be executed as follows:

1. Install Go on your local machine.
2. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/voukatas/golang-projects.git
3. Navigate into each individual folder and run go run main.go (or whichever file you'd like to run).

#W Progress
This journey is ongoing, and as I continue learning, this repository will be updated with new projects and concepts. Check back often for updates!

# Connect with me
I would love to connect with fellow learners and experienced Golang developers alike! You can reach me on Twitter @reversesec

Happy coding and learning!
